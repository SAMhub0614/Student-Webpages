# Shania Martinez-Sanchez - Final Portfolio Project

## 👋 About Me

Hello! My name is Shania Martinez-Sanchez and I am a senior at Mt. Eden High School. This portfolio represents my final project for my Computer Science class. Over the course of the year, I’ve developed a passion for programming and learned a lot about the basics of coding and game development. This site showcases what I’ve built and learned.

## 🖥️ What This Site Includes

This website is a collection of the projects I’ve created during the school year. In Computer Science, I learned how to:

- Write functions
- Use conditional statements
- Work with loops and events
- Develop interactive games with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

It was an exciting experience seeing how code can be used to make games and tools. I enjoyed watching my progress from simple exercises to full projects.
